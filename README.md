# Zebra

A vector database for querying meaningfully similar data.
The database can be extended to support documents of many data types; at the moment, text, image, and audio data are supported.

## The name

Zebras (like other equines) make a 'neigh' sound. The database performs a nearest-*neigh*bour search to find similar data.

## Installation
With the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) installed, run the following command:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/emmyoh/zebra
```
